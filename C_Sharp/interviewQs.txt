Core C# language

What’s the difference between class, struct, and record? When would you choose each?

Explain const vs readonly vs static readonly.

What are ref, out, and in parameters? Give a use-case for each.

How do ==, Equals, and ReferenceEquals differ? What changes with records?

What is boxing/unboxing? Where can it hurt performance?

Explain using statement vs using declaration. How does IDisposable fit in?

What does init mean on a property? How is it different from set?

var vs explicit typing: what does the compiler actually do?

Collections, LINQ, and data shaping

IEnumerable<T> vs ICollection<T> vs IList<T>: what guarantees do you get?

When would you use HashSet<T> over List<T>?

Write a LINQ query to: group tests by suite, count pass/fail, and order by failure rate.

What’s deferred execution in LINQ? Name a bug it can cause in tests.

Select vs SelectMany—what’s the mental model?

How would you remove duplicates from a list of complex objects? (Equality options?)

Exceptions and reliability

When should you throw vs return an error result? (API design in C#)

Why is catching Exception usually a code smell? When is it acceptable?

Explain try/finally vs using. What happens if Dispose() throws?

How do you build exception messages that are useful for debugging?

Async/await and concurrency

Explain the difference between Task and Thread.

Why can .Result / .Wait() deadlock? What’s the safer alternative?

What’s the difference between Task.WhenAll and Task.WhenAny?

How do you implement a timeout for an async operation properly?

What is ConfigureAwait(false) and when does it matter?

How do you limit concurrency to N tasks at once?

Test automation scenarios (SDET-flavored)

You have flaky tests due to timeouts—design a retry strategy that doesn’t hide real failures.

Given raw log lines, parse them into objects and produce a failure summary report.

Build a “signature” for failures to dedupe: what fields belong in the signature and why?

You must compare yesterday vs today results and detect new failures and fixed tests.

How would you structure a helper library so it’s testable and doesn’t become a “god class”?

OOP and design

What’s the difference between interface inheritance and implementation inheritance?

Explain SOLID with one example each in C#.

When do you prefer composition over inheritance? Give a real example.

What is dependency injection? How does it improve testing?

Performance basics

How do you spot accidental quadratic behavior in C# code (common patterns)?

string concatenation in a loop: what’s wrong and what’s better?

What does Span<T> help with conceptually? When would you avoid it?

Debugging and code-reading

Given a failing test that passes locally but fails in CI, list your investigation steps.

Explain common causes of nondeterminism in tests (time, random, shared state, parallelism).

You see intermittent ObjectDisposedException—what patterns cause this?

You see InvalidOperationException: Collection was modified—why does it happen and fixes?
